This is the competition run by Isbank on Kaggle. Even though I didn't achieve a ranking in this competition, I can say that I gained a lot of valuable experience.

The competition was about developing a recommendation system. Using masked user data, I needed to establish a connection between different users and their data, and recommend 3 out of the existing 9 menu items to these new users.

I couldn't allocate enough time for the competition, and I had limited time ahead. After reading some articles on the internet, I attempted to develop a few advanced models like DLRM and NeuMF. Later, I realized that these models wouldn't yield good results for this competition because they were not related to the challenge's problem set by Isbank. Nevertheless, I believe that learning how to navigate through the literature will be very useful for me in the future. Additionally, thanks to this competition, I became aware of the existence of the Optuna framework.

Instead of advanced models, using more traditional models like XGBoost and tuning hyperparameters could have placed me in a better position. Also, I overlooked the fact that the data was normalized with different parameters in different months, even though I examined the data before starting to code. This taught me the importance of carefully examining the data in my future work.

I am not sharing some files, codes and models for data privacy reasons.
